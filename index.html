        This website is all about me. 
        There is a home page (where you are currently), an about page, and a portolio page.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am currently studying at FullStack Academy to become a web developer.
        I plan on using this page as a practice page to apply the new skills I learn and to show off to possible employers.
